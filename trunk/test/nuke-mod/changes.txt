1)  I had to put the autoindex.php and other files in the document 
root.
They needed to be in the same directory as modules.php.

2) I had to comment out a function for is_admin() because PHPNuke 
already
uses that.

3) With your help I changed the URL to say doc=$filename instead of
file=$filename because PHPNuke already uses the file= syntax.

4) I had to comment out some of the stuff in your script that created 
the
body tags etc. because that stuff is already done by PHPNuke's 
header.php
file.
